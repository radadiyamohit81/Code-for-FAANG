# Tries-1

## Problem1 
Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)(https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)

Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.

Example:

Trie trie = new Trie();

trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // returns true
trie.search("app");     // returns false
trie.startsWith("app"); // returns true
trie.insert("app");   
trie.search("app");     // returns true
Note:

You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
All inputs are guaranteed to be non-empty strings.


## Problem2
Longest Word in Dictionary(https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/)

Given a list of strings words representing an English Dictionary, find the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words. If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

If there is no answer, return the empty string.
Example 1:
Input: 
words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: 
The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
Example 2:
Input: 
words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: 
Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
Note:

All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
The length of words will be in the range [1, 1000].
The length of words[i] will be in the range [1, 30].

## Problem3
Replace Words (https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/)


In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:

Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
 

Note:

The input will only have lower-case letters.
1 <= dict words number <= 1000
1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
1 <= root length <= 100
1 <= sentence words length <= 1000
