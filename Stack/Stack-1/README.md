## Problem1 Daily Temperatures (https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

## Problem2 Next Greater Element II (https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,1]

Output: [2,-1,2]

Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 

The number 2 can't find next greater number; 

The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.
